<p>
  <strong>“Summer Innovative Teaching Program“</strong>    
</p>
</center>
<p>
    The nature of web application development in real-world work is to be conducted mostly by teams.
    Moreover, students learn a lot from their peers. During the summer semester, the course will adopt the
    innovative approach of <strong> inquiry-based learning </strong> where real cases are presented, plans are discussed,
    solutions and resources are explored, and ideas and reflections are shared. The course will emphasize this
    practice further by encouraging collaborative groups. Besides online in-class discussions, students are
    expected to work in monitored teams to gain technical knowledge and skills to create reliable secure
    database-driven and appealing hybrid web applications that are search-engine optimized and crossplatform compatible that automatically adjust to look good on all devices from smart phones to desktop
    computers. No major or final exams, but to assure the attainment of the course outcomes, assessment
    will be composed of individual short quizzes and portfolios in addition to walk-through team projects and
    presentations.

<p><strong>Assessment Methods
</strong></p>
<ul>
    Various assessment methods will be utilized for formative (to provide feedback and reinforce
    learning) as well as summative methods (to reflect achievement in the transcript). However, to
    demote freeloaders, students will submit work distributions and oral examination for individual
    members to ensure their engagement on specific tasks.
